<h2>Project Suppa - Automating Grocery Lists</h2>

<p>
We make all<sup>1</sup> of our meals at home. With busy weeknights, it requires a lot of planning<sup>2</sup>. One step of the process that I find particularly tedious is taking the ingredient lists from each of the ~8-10 recipes and combining them into a single shopping list. To save time at the store, I like the single shopping list 1) to have the same item combined, i.e. 6 garlic cloves instead of 2 garlic cloves repeated 3 times and 2) to be sorted by aisle so I can do one loop through the store<sup>3</sup>.
</p>

<p>
Project Suppa automates this step to save me 15 minutes every week and avoid that annoying trip back to the store because I made a goof when combining my list.
</p>

<p>
Just paste the ingredients lists from your recipes into left text entry box and out will pop the combined, sorted shopping list<sup>4</sup> on the right. Maybe this tool will save you some time too!

[EDIT - 2025-07-31] The model is now 8-bit quantized reducing the model size to 40mb.
</p>

<p>
[EDIT - 2025-07-21] There's a handy copy button on the top right on the list!.

[EDIT - 2025-06-06] I retrained the model using outputs from Gemini 2.5 Flash.

<div style="font-size: 0.9em;">
<p><strong>1.</strong> Ok, well, not all but almost all. We get bagels once a week for breakfast and reserve a day for leftovers or takeout.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Maybe more on our comprehensive (some would say ridiculous) planning process later.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Ya, I still shop for groceries in person, at least for perishables. I like to see which produce is fresh and fragrant.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Ok, it's not quite perfect yet, but it still saves me some time.</p>
