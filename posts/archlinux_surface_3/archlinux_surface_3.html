<h2>Running Arch Linux on a Surface 3</h2>

<p>
I run Arch Linux on all of my computers (except the <a href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=108331">tragedy of the 12" Macbook</a>) so using Windows on my Surface 3 created issues. Mostly, it was hard to view and edit OneNote files across my devices. I wanted to use <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xournal/">Xournal</a>, an open-source note-taking app, which runs natively on GNU/Linux.
</p>

<p>
Here are the steps I followed to get Arch up and running:
</p>

<h3>Shrink Windows Partition</h3>
<p>
First, to get some disk space to install Linux, shrink the Windows partition by:
<ol>
  <li>opening <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/manage/administrative-tools-in-windows-10">Computer Management</a>,</li>
  <li>right-clicking the C:\ drive,</li>
  <li>and selecting 'Shrink Volume'</li>
</ol>

You will need 5-20+ GB for the Linux installation depending on which applications you install and how much space you want for any personal code, documents, media, etc.
</p>
<p>
It's likely that Windows will tell you that there isn't enough disk space available to shrink more than 2GB. I tried each of these until the available disk space reflected the actual disk usage:
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/347927/how-to-really-turn-off-hibernation-in-windows-7/34792">Disabling hibernate</a> by running <code>powercfg /h off</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15055/windows-7-optimize-windows-better-performance#1TC=windows-7">Disabling virtual memory</a> by disabling automatic virtual memory and setting the page file size to 0.</li>
  <li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff458356.aspx">Defragmenting the disk</a> by running <code>defrag C: /X /H</code>.</li>
  <li>Rebooting.</li>
</ol>
Each of these changes can be reversed after the disk is resized.
</p>

<h3>Disable Secure Boot</h3>
<p>
Secure Boot verifies the boot loader against a local list of approved kernels before booting. Naturally, our to-be-installed Linux kernel is not approved and thus will not boot. Temporarily disable Secure Boot by:
<ol>
  <li>holding volume-up and pressing and releasing the power button to enter the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/how-to-use-the-bios-uefi?os=windows-10&=undefined">BIOS</a></li>
  <li>disabling Secure Boot</li>
</ol>
Later, we'll re-enable Secure Boot to eliminate the unsightly, bright-red boot screen.

</p>

<h3>Install Arch Linux</h3>
<p>
Follow the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide">wiki instructions</a> to install Arch using a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media">USB drive</a>.
<ol>
  <li>If you do not see the Arch installation screen, try changing the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/storage-files-and-folders/boot-surface-from-usb-recovery-device?os=windows-10&=undefined">boot order</a> in the BIOS.</li>
  <li>Make sure to not overwrite Windows when partitioning the disks. Observing the partition types from the output of <code>fdisk -l</code> should indicate the Windows partition.</li>
  <li>If you have issues connecting to the internet, use a USB Ethernet adapter.</li>
  <li>Boot into Linux (and Windows if you really have to) using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot#EFI_boot">systemd-boot EFI boot</a>.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The Linux kernel has improved its Surface 3 support incrementally over the last few years. For full hardware support, install the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-surface3-git/">latest Linux kernel with some proposed Surface 3 patches</a>. The included patches add a battery driver, support for lid status and backlight control, and improve the stability of the wireless driver.
</p>

<h3>Re-enable Secure boot</h3>
<p>
In order to avoid the new kernel being blocked by Secure Boot, we must register its hash the Surface's database. Follow the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Secure_Boot#PreLoader">PreLoader instructions</a> to install a hash tool that can add the hash of the just-installed Linux kernel to the database. Be sure to use the <a href="http://blog.hansenpartnership.com/linux-foundation-secure-boot-system-released/">signed</a> <code>PreLoader.efi</code> and <code>HashTool.efi</code>.
</p>
<p>
If successful, the installation should provide a screen that allows you to enroll the hash of the new kernel.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
After enrolling the hash, re-enable Secure Boot in the BIOS.
</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>
Some configuration is needed to reach reasonable defaults for the Surface 3 hardware.
</p>

<h4>Inputs</h4>
<p>
The Type Cover, touchscreen, touchpad, and pen all work great using the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Libinput">libinput</a> driver. Only the pen needs some configuration so that libinput is used. Utilize an <a href="https://github.com/chadvoegele/system-configs/blob/master/chadsurface/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-spi_pen.conf.pkg">input config</a> in xorg.conf.d to force the pen to use the libinput driver.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier      "Surface Pen"
    MatchProduct    "Surface3 SPI Pen Input"
    MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
    Driver          "libinput"
EndSection
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Any customizations to the keyboard layout or repeat rate will be lost upon detaching and reattaching the Type Cover if they are made by <code>setxkbmap</code> and <code>xset r</code>. The keyboard layout configuration will be reapplied if made using a <a href="https://github.com/chadvoegele/system-configs/blob/master/chadsurface/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf.pkg">configuration file</a> in xorg.conf.d.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "seyboard"
    MatchIsKeyboard "on"
    Option "XkbLayout" "us_prog"
    Option "XKbOptions" "ctrl:nocaps"
EndSection
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The repeat rate will be reapplied if set when invoking <code>X</code> to run the X server. For example, use <code>startx -- -ardelay 250 -arinterval 20 vt1</code> in your .bashrc or <a href="https://github.com/chadvoegele/configs/blob/master/chadsurface/.zshrc">.zshrc</a>.
</p>

<h4>Backlight</h4>
<p>
Change the backlight brightness with <code>xbacklight -set 10</code>.
</p>

<h4>HiDPI</h4>
<p>
The high-pixel density display on the Surface 3 will make some applications look small. Follow the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI">HiDPI instructions</a> to configure your applications for the HiDPI display.
</p>

<h3>Software</h3>
<p>
Utilizing the Surface 3 as a laptop does not require special software, but with the lack of a keyboard in tablet mode some additions are necessary.
</p>

<h4>Xournal</h4>
<p>
Xournal needs some configuration to behave like OneNote. In particular, to drag the page with your finger but still use the pen to write requires <a href="https://github.com/chadvoegele/configs/blob/master/chadsurface/.xournal/config">enabling</a> 'Touchscreen as Hand Tool' and setting the touchscreen device to 'Surface3 SPI Capacitive TouchScreen'.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, I see phantom strokes in the top-right corner that add unwanted outbursts to my note. (This is very common when using the <code>evdev</code> driver but not as often with <code>libinput</code>).
</p>

</p>

<p>
A temporary, hacky <a href="https://gist.github.com/chadvoegele/ab34aa7fb7cd2c1d4ce644fd67c39440">fix</a> is to ignore stokes with an unusually large hypotenuse.
</p>

</p>

<h4>On-screen Keyboard</h4>
<p>
For a touch keyboard, I've found <a href="https://launchpad.net/onboard">onboard</a> to work well.
</p>

<h4>Application Switching</h4>
<p>
To switch applications without the keyboard, the <a href="https://github.com/richardgv/skippy-xd">skippy-xd</a> application emulates the Mac OS X expos√© feature. A switch can be activated using a hardware button such as Volume-Up with <code>xbindkeys</code>.
</p>

<h4>Easystroke</h4>
<p>
Arbitrary commands and actions can be executed with pen gestures through <a href="https://github.com/thjaeger/easystroke">easystroke</a>. This includes interaction with the window manager or X using automation tools such as <code>wmctrl</code>, <code>xdotool</code>, and <code>xte</code>.
</p>

<h3>Issues</h3>
<p>
These features do not work in Linux:
<ul>
  <li>Second button on pen</li>
  <li>Top, purple button on pen</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
These features I haven't tested:
<ul>
  <li>Display port output</li>
  <li>Cameras</li>
  <li>Lid switch</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Patches are welcome!
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
This setup makes my Surface 3 work great as a pen and paper replacement and as a tablet for PDF reading! With Wi-Fi turned off, I get up to 13 hours battery life and up to 9 with it on.
</p>
<p>
I hope this post might be useful for someone else trying to run Arch on their Surface 3!
