<h2>Updating Google Dynamic DNS on dd-wrt</h2>
<p>
After being worn down by <a href="https://www.noip.com/">noip.com</a> confirmation emails, I switched to Google Domains since they include dynamic DNS support with a domain purchase. Google DDNS was easy to set up on my ASUS RT-AC68U with its built-in support. However recently my router was mistakenly bringing down my connection due to DHCP issues so I immediately switched to dd-wrt. Everything about dd-wrt is great... except it has no built-in support for <a href="https://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/DDNS_-_How_to_setup_Custom_DDNS_settings_using_embedded_inadyn_-_HOWTO#Secure_DDNS_Updates_Over_HTTPS.2FSSL">Dynamic DNS over HTTPS/SSL</a> which Google Domains requires!
</p>
<p>
The wiki pointed me to a <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Useful_Scripts#DynDNS_Updates_Using_Curl_.28with_HTTPS.2FSSL_Support.29">curl script</a> however <code>curl</code> failed to complete the TLS handshake with the error <code>error:140943FC:lib(20):func(148):reason(1020)</code> which is due to an <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=309557">unsupported cipher</a>. Luckily there is an easy, if less secure, workaround until <code>curl</code> on dd-wrt is upgraded. Run <code>curl</code> with <code>--tlsv1.1</code> to negotiate down to TLS 1.1.
</p>

<p>
With this change, I have Google Dynamic DNS support on dd-wrt with this startup script and script!

<p>
Hopefully you also will be relieved of <a href="https://www.noip.com/">noip.com</a> emails!
